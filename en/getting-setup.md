1. These Sushi Cards will help you learn to build webpages using PHP, a very popular programming language that's used to build websites like *Facebook* and *Wikipedia*. You can combine it with *HTML* (and check out the HTML Sushi Cards if you don't know how to code HTML yet!).
2. First, you're going to need somewhere to code! PHP needs a few different pieces in place to make it work and, if you're going to release a website later, you'll eventually need to learn how to set that up. For now, though, let's just get going quickly by using Cloud 9, an online editor that will do all the setup for you! Check it out at [dojo.soy/php-edit](http://dojo.soy/php-edit).
